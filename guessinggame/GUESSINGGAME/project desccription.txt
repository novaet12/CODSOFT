from the given instructions i have dicided too use this :
1. Generate a random number within a specified range, such as 1 to 100.
2. Prompt the user to enter their guess for the generated number.
3. Compare the user's guess with the generated number and provide feedback on whether the guess is correct, too high, or too low.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the user guesses the correct number.
5. Limit the number of attempts the user has to guess the number.
6. Display the user's score, which can be based on the number of attempts taken or rounds won.

and i have used some codes from stackoverflow and some youtube videos
by modularization pricple i used separate files to manage the score,the functions and a main page

to run the code the main file is the one that is labeld numbergame
